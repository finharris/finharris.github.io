        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          StringyyBot is a bot that I created for use on my
          <a href="https://discord.gg/aunMP6z">discord server</a>. It was
          created by myself so that I can have custom commands that are
          individual to my server and so that I can create my own commands
          tailored to my needs.
